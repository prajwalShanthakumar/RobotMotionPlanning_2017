# RobotMotionPlanning_2017
MATLAB implementation of a variety of path planning algorithms

This repository contains robot motion planning algorithms being implemented as part of 
the Spring 2017 Robot Motion Planning course (ECE 5984) at Virginia Tech.

The implemented solutions are being pushed onto GitHub after the homework due date.
This repository will be deleted/made private when the course is offered again.
